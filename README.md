I find [this article](https://learn.g2.com/stages-of-game-development) kind of interesting.

## Why I find it interesting

The article talks about the stages of developing a game, and since I was planning on being a game developer at some point, I was very interested in reading what goes into it. The article goes into decent details about each of the **stages** of game developement and I think it gave me enough information to start working on my game dev internship and understand what everyone else is talking about.

I also found it very interesting that even though games and other softwares seem very different, the developement processes seem extremely similar. I guess that *should* be expected since games *are* softwares as well.

I find this article very interesting as well, as I have always wondered what goes into developing a game but never actually looked it up. In general, the process wasn't too far off from what I already imagined, but it is cool to see the specific teams that work together and the steps they take.
